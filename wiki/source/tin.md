tin is a threaded NNTP and spool based [UseNet](usenet-news.html) newsreader for a variety of platforms.

[http://www.tin.org/](http://www.tin.org/)

it is an actively maintained project, and is installed on ``tilde.club``. `tin` should be invoked as `tin -r` to read from the remote news spool. Use <tab> to go to the next unread article and `w` to write a new article.

if you have `tin` on your local box and can do [[ssh port forwarding]], you can read news using it. (details forthcoming).
